GPU accelerated k-means algoritm using CUDA.

Overall 52 times faster than CPU code.

Copy the datasets from the "data" folder into ./build/Src/kmeans/Release, and run kmeans.exe under the same path.
"predition.txt" is the generated prediction of labels.
"time_and_accuracy.png" is the result of our experiment.
